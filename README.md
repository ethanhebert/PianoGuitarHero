# PianoGuitarHero

Personal project.
Turn your keyboard or a guitar hero controller into an instrument.

This stems from a class project where we had to create a sound wave and make it play.
I've added a GUI, 4 different sound waves to switch between, the capability to play the computer keyboard as a musical keyboard with key mappings similar to a DAW, and the ability to plug a Guitar Hero controller into the computer and use it to actually play notes like a real guitar. The sound output can even be routed to a guitar pedal board and amp, so you can play a Guitar Hero controller live at gigs although it plays more like a synth. One of my goofiest and favorite projects ever.
